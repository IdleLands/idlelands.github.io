There are a lot of different maps to explore in IdleLands. You can travel to different maps using portals, ladders, holes or teleport scrolls. You can find all the maps in the game [on GitHub](https://github.com/IdleLands/Maps), and there is a handy [wiki page about mapmaking](https://github.com/IdleLands/IdleLands/wiki/Mapmaking) if you're interested.

The main part of the world is Norkos and it looks like this:

Another big part of the world is Cabran, which looks like this:
