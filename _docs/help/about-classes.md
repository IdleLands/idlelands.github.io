Classes, AKA “In what way do I beat up enemies?”

There are 15 classes available to play as, some available straight away and some that require a little seeking out. All new players start as the Generalist, but your class can be switched by finding a Trainer in the world (Hover your mouse over people on the map to see a tooltip about who they are!) and stepping on the tile they’re in. This will bring up a choice in your choice log enabling you to switch class (Note: you can only have one change class choice in your log at any time).

All classes have different styles in battle, different weighting to their [stats](https://idle.land/docs/stats/) and different abilities. Many class abilities improve based on your level, how often you’ve switched to that class, or how often you’ve used that ability.

So, what are the classes and what do they do?

#### Bard
Every adventure needs a great soundtrack, and the Bard uses their special song stat and singing voice to deal damage, drain a targets stats or buff members of their party. Outside of battle, the Bard can use their ability:

Orchestra: Start a random festival that lasts an hour. (60 Stamina)

Bardic Festivals provide buffs (or debuffs) to all players while active.
