### Getting Started

Welcome to IdleLands! There's a lot to unpack about this game, but for now, why not check out the [New Player Guide](https://idle.land/docs/new-player/)?

There are three categories to the help documents.
- About The Game: contains general information about the game.
- Player Help: contains information that is necessary to play the game.
- About The Game Internals: contains information for content creators.

Please have a browse around and if there is something you cannot find on here feel free to ask a question in the chat.
